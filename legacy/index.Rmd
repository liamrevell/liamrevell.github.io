Some of the applications in the R package [*covid19.Explorer*](https://github.com/liamrevell/covid19.Explorer/) and *shiny*-based website [covid19-explorer.org](https://covid19-explorer.org) are based on assumptions (for instance, a consistent relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths) that are no longer valid due to the success of mass-vaccination programs in the U.S. and other countries.

Some of these applications have been removed from this site. Others are left but no longer updated.
